      <p> Heiii, Aleybear, my little insufferable demon. I don't really know what to say in a birthday message, but, I just wanna say that maybe this day 
        is just another day for you, cake and drinking and stuff. But for me, it's kind of a special day, because it's the day you were 
        born, and it led to us meeting and forging this strange little bond with such a small chance. Both of us vibed, loved, admired 
        and were obsessed with each other in just a short span of time and of course, I'm still kinda sad how it turned out even 
        though we're still gonna be friends and for many years more. Aley, I loved you and I adored you. I was patient and I was 
        understanding, but, ending that deeper kind of relationship changed things. I'm still reeling from the sudden change of 
        direction but, yeah, I hope you'd do well in the future. I mean, I'll still be here with you. For me, despite 
        how damaged and broken you are, you're still a gentle and beautiful soul. I also grieve for the things that what could've been for 
        us, all the hopes and dreams. But, I'll be fine. And I hope that we'll find our way through life without having to face a 
        lot of bad consequences. I'll be here for you, if things get real messy and hopefully, you'd be there for me as well. 
         Who knows what the future holds for both of us. A lot of unexpected things, for sure. 
         And yeah, Happy Birthday, my babygorilla. 

        Love you lots. Love you still. Love you the same. Until it ends.
        
        Enjoy your day‚ô•Ô∏è</p>
