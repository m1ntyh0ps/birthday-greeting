      <p> Heii Aleyy, my little baby demon. Happy Birthday!

Mhm, İ don’t really know where to start cus İ'm not much to write birthday messages, but İ just want to say that İ love you. I care about you so much. Not just as someone I’ve been close to, but as someone I 
        truly see. You’re a rare kind of person. Soft, thoughtful, and real. <p>

İ know life hasn’t always been kind to you. And sometimes the world makes you feel like you’re supposed to live a certain way or act a certain way, hit all the marks. But honestly, I don’t think you really 
        have to. İ think it’s okay to live differently. You don’t have to follow anyone else’s pace. You just need some space to grow in your own way. <p>

İ worry sometimes about you. İ get scared when İ see you hurting or unsure. Maybe it’s just an ADHD thing or just who İ am, idkk, but İ always want things to turn out okay for you. And when you don’t take my 
        advice, İ start to panic a bit cus İ feel like something might fall apart. But İ guess it's just the way it is, this is your life, your path. İ'm just someone who believes in you, even when you're 
        still figuring things out. <p>

And no matter what you choose to do, whether it’s what your friends suggest or what you feel inside, İ’ll still care. İ'll still be here. İ’m not trying to fix you or guide every move you make. 
        I just want you to be okay. To feel okay. <p>

You’re not falling behind. You’re just moving differently. That’s not wrong. It’s just you. <p>

İ hope this year brings you peace, clarity, maybe even joy. And I hope you start to feel more like you, not what the world expects from you. <p>

İ'm proud of you for making it this far. İ'm proud of the little soul you carry. Such a fragile little soul. And İ just simply adore it. <p>

You’ll always have a place with me. <p> 

p.s. İ almost cried writing this message🫠 i just luv you so much. and enjoy your day, okay?? take care, babycakes
